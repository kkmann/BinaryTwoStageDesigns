# Welcome!

*Functionality for working with exact single-arm two-stage designs for
clinical trials with binary endpoint.*

Special focus lies on the computation of optimal two-stage designs extending
the ideas of Simon [1] using the [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
programming language.
[BinaryTwoStageDesigns](https://github.com/imbi-heidelberg/BinaryTwoStageDesigns) relies heavily on the functionality of the
[JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) package and is tested against the
commercial mixed integer programming solver [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/index).
While JuMP supports other solvers the use of Gurobi is highly recommended.
Academic licenses for Gurobi can be obtained free of charge upon request.
